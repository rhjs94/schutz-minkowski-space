# schutz-minkowski-space
Formalisation in Isabelle/HOL of Schutz' axioms for Minkowski spacetime (and theorems of Chapter 3).
This is intended to be exactly the same as is hosted on the AFP - however, you should prefer the latter version, found under this link: [https://afp.theoremproving.org/entries/schutz_spacetime/](https://afp.theoremproving.org/entries/schutz_spacetime/). 

Use `isabelle build -D .` from the folder `schutz_spacetime` to build the Isabelle session and generate the pdf. To send to the AFP, include the entire `schutz_spacetime` folder.
